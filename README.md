"Python First Steps!!" is a beginner learning project designed to introduce fundamental concepts in Python programming. The project focuses on essential topics such as lists, functions (defined with 'def'), and other basic Python constructs. Participants in this learning journey will gain hands-on experience working with lists, defining functions to encapsulate code, and mastering foundational skills that serve as a solid starting point for further Python exploration. The project aims to provide a practical and engaging introduction to the key building blocks of Python, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the language.
